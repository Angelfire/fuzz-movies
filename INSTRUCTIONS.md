# Tech test


## Steps to implement
- Make an API key following the steps here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
- Film search (using this API endpoint GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key={apikey}&query=<search_query>), display the films in whatever UI you want.
- The user should be able to see details of the film (endpoint GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key={apikey})
- The user should be able to favorite and unfavorite a movie (use whatever local storage that you think make sense)
- The user should be able to see a list of favorite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen)

## Tips
- Spend some time on transitions/animations and the small tweaks that make an app nice to use
- Focus on good naming
- If you end up with complex code, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, document the thoughts behind it

## Before you start
You can use any frameworks and/or architecture you like, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills.

We know you are under a time limit and we will of course take this into account. It's perfectly fine to cut corners and focus on certain parts.
This challenge is intentionally left relatively 'open' - we give you only enough information to get started. You may need to make some assumptions and decisions to get going. Please let us know what these assumptions are as this will be helpful when we evaluate your response.
